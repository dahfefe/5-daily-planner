# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Description

This simple daily scheduler allows the user to create a task list based on a 9am-5pm daily schedule. The page displays the current day at the top of the page and each hour block is color coded based on the current time of day. The hour blocks will change color based on whether the hour is in the past, the current hour, or in the future. There are save buttons per each hour block that allows the user to save each time block individually and save such data to faithfully save all entered tasks for the day in case the page reloads.
